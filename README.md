# Node Client/Server

Version 1.1 : 30-Dec-2017

Example Node.js project that illustrates client server exchanges using AJAX with JSON data.

The project "requires" only 'http', 'path', and 'fs'. It uses jQuery, knockout, and w3.css.

The code is written in TypeScript.

The client index.html page has 3 edit boxes that hold numbers to be sent to a 'calculate' function on
the server. There is a 'result' box, and a 'Calculate' button.

When the calculate button is pressed, the 3 values are collected into a JSON object and sent to the
server via AJAX. The server adds the 3 values together and returns the sum, which is displayed on
the web page.

Have added 'start.sh' script that will start the server and open a google chrome window that will
be resized when the application starts. Substitute chromium-browser for google-chrome-stable if
you're using chromium.

The package.json file was updated to use this script, so starting the application with 'npm start'
will do the same thing as executing start.sh.

You can compile the project with "Ctrl-Shift-B" while in Visual Studio Code.

**BONUS FEATURE**

Added window resize to 'client/index.ts' so that if the browser is started as a new window in
application mode, the window will become smaller to fit the user interface. There will be no
tabs, bookmarks, etc.

Yes, it's then a Web App...

You can start Chrome or chromium or Chrome from the command line to do this:
```sh
google-chrome-stable --new-window --app=http://localhost:8080/index.html
    --OR--
chromium-browser --new-window --app=http://localhost:8080/index.html
```
